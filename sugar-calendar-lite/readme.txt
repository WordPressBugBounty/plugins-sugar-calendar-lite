## Key Features at a Glance

The core free version of Sugar Calendar provides a comprehensive toolkit for creating a functional event calendar and managing basic event registration and ticketing right away. It's the perfect starting point for straightforward event management.

### Simple Event Creation & Management

New to event management? Our intuitive step-by-step guide walks you through creating your first event. From adding the event name and description to setting the duration, recurrence, and venue, we make the process seamless.

Create events effortlessly within your WordPress dashboard using our clean, clutter-free interface. Define event details like dates and times (including all-day or multi-day options), and manage your events calendar entries just like standard posts.

### Calendar and List View Displays

Showcase your events effectively with multiple display options. Embed a monthly event calendar view or an upcoming events list anywhere using Gutenberg blocks, Elementor widgets, or shortcodes.

Visitors can easily switch between month, week, or day views for optimal browsing of your events calendar.  Both calendar and list layouts are fully responsive (and even support an optional dark mode).

### Sell Tickets with Stripe

Monetize your events without needing extra extensions\! Sugar Calendar integrates directly with Stripe, enabling secure credit card payments for paid event registration.

As a [verified Stripe partner](https://stripe.com/accept-payments/sugar-calendar), we ensure a reliable payment integration for your event management needs

This program recognizes software that meets Stripe’s strict quality requirements and provides users of Sugar Calendar and Stripe with the confidence they need to trust us both with their payment integrations.

### Multiple Calendars (Event Categories)

Structure your events by organizing them into distinct calendars or categories. Create unique calendars for different event types, departments, or topics, and empower visitors to filter events, improving their experience with your events calendar.

### Migrating from The Events Calendar?

Are you migrating away from *The Events Calendar* plugin and want an easy events management solution to migrate to? Don’t worry, we've got you covered. It’s as easy as a single click of a button to migrate all your events and other details in *The Events Calendar* plugin to Sugar Calendar.

### Calendar Feeds (iCal/Google Calendar Sync)

Let your users subscribe to your events calendar in their personal calendar apps. Sugar Calendar provides iCal/ICS calendar feeds and offers attendees convenient "Add to Calendar" options for Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, or direct .ics download.

### Google Maps Integration

Display a Google Map for your event venue/location on the event details page. Just enter the event address, and Sugar Calendar will show an interactive map, helping attendees easily find your event.

### Event Tags for Filtering

Organize and categorize your events using customizable tags, similar to WordPress post tags. Assign relevant tags to events, allowing visitors to easily filter the events calendar on the frontend to find exactly what they're looking for. This adds another layer to your event management strategy.

### Attendee Management & Export

Keep track of attendees and ticket orders in your WordPress dashboard. For each event, you can view the list of attendees/ticket holders and their details. Need to share or analyze data? Export attendees or event lists to CSV with one click.

### Import/Export Events

Migrate or back up your event data easily. Sugar Calendar can help export your events and other data by compiling a JSON file that can be downloaded to your computer. You can also import events from a JSON export file.

### Custom Date and Time Formats

Customize how event dates and times are displayed to match your locale or preference. Choose from common date/time formats or use your own format – perfect for international sites.

### Dashboard Events Widget

Get a quick overview of upcoming events directly from your WordPress dashboard. The handy widget keeps your schedule visible, ensuring efficient event management at a glance. (Pro users see enhanced details like venue and RSVP attendees.)

### Gutenberg Blocks & Elementor Widgets

Seamlessly integrate your event calendar or events list anywhere on your site. Dedicated blocks for the Gutenberg editor and widgets for Elementor and other popular builders make adding your events calendar to pages, posts, or sidebars incredibly simple. Shortcodes are also available for other editors.

### Modern, Lightweight Design

Sugar Calendar is optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring it won’t slow down your site. The admin interface is intuitive and beautifully designed, making event management a breeze.

Your frontend event calendar naturally inherits your theme's styles and even supports dark mode for a seamless look.

### Translation Ready

Fully localized and ready for translation. Sugar Calendar has already been translated into 10+ languages and can be easily translated into your language, so your events calendar can serve audiences worldwide.

## Sugar Calendar Pro Features

Want to unlock more advanced **event management** capabilities? Sugar Calendar Pro (available with a [premium license](https://sugarcalendar.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp-readme&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=premium-license-plans)) includes all the free features plus many powerful enhancements to help you stay organized and grow your events:

### Advanced Event Registration & RSVP Management

Take control of your guest lists with our sophisticated RSVP system, included as part of Sugar Calendar Pro via the dedicated RSVP Addon. This feature introduces a dedicated "RSVP" tab within the Sugar Calendar menu in your WordPress dashboard.

This takes you directly to a comprehensive attendee management screen, where event organizers can effortlessly track guest responses, viewing a detailed list of everyone who has indicated they are "Going" or "Not Going" to an event.

### Recurring Events

**Schedule events** to repeat automatically on a daily, weekly, monthly, or custom schedule. Save time by creating recurring events (including complex recurrence patterns like the first Monday of the month or every other Thursday) instead of manually duplicating events in your events calendar.

### Event Venues & Locations

Create and manage reusable venue profiles. Store addresses, maps, contact details, and website links for each location.

Assign venues to events to display rich location information (and a Google Map) easily, perfect for recurring events at the same place and enhancing your overall events management.

### Speakers Management

Easily add speaker or performer profiles to your events. Include names, titles, bios, photos, and social links to highlight who will be featured, enhancing your event listings.

### Frontend Event Submissions

Accept event submissions from your community or team without giving them backend access. Sugar Calendar Pro integrates with popular form plugins (WPForms, Gravity Forms, Formidable Forms) to allow frontend event submission forms.

Visitors can submit events through a form on your site, and you can review/publish them at your convenience. Perfect for community calendars and user-submitted events.

### Event Duplication

Clone any existing event with one click to use it as a template. This handy feature allows you to quickly duplicate events (including all details and settings) and then just make minor edits, instead of recreating similar events from scratch, saving you significant time in your event management workflow.

### Import Events from Google, Apple, Outlook, and other 3rd party Calendars

Sugar Calendar Pro lets you import events from any 3rd party calendar with an ICS URL. It works with Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other calendars. All it requires is simply pasting the ICS URL in the import tool.

### Enhanced Dashboard Widget

Pro users see more details in the dashboard widget, including event venues, assigned speakers/performers, and quick-access icons for recurring events and RSVP/ticket attendee lists, offering a richer overview for effective event management.

### Event Link (Custom Event URLs)

Need to redirect an event to an external page or ticketing site? Pro allows you to set a custom URL for each event. Use this to link out to external event pages, third-party ticketing platforms, or any URL instead of the default event detail page for specialized event registration.
